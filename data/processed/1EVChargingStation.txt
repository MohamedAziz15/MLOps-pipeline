An electric vehicle, also called an EV, uses one or more electric motors or traction  motors for  propulsion.  An  electric  vehicle  may  be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may  be  self-contained  with a battery, solar panels or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.
An electric vehicle charging station , also called EV charging station, electric recharging point, charging point, charge point and electronic charging station (ECS) is an element in an infrastructure that supplies electric energy for the recharging of plug-in electric vehicles-including electric  cars, neighbourhood  electric  Vehicles  and plug-in hybrids.
Nowadays, energy efficiency is a top priority, boosted by a major concern with climatic changes and by the soaring oil prices in countries that have a large dependency on imported fossil fuels, which leads to the demand of EV charging station in the country.Benefits of E-vehicle Charging Station
-  Increase in number of charging stations will boost the selling of EV's as their will be reduced range anxiety.
-  It is always great for environment.
-  It will boost direct and indirect employment in country.
-  Good Opportunity for young entrepreneur to install charging sttsaion in their locality.EV Charging station Market Analysis
In the first phase of Electric Vehicles (EV) rollout plan, the power ministry is targetting 4 billion-plus population cities under the EV policy initiative. It plans to cover all the state capitals, union territories, major highways and key cities under the second phase.
The electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of over 40% during the forecast period 2019-2025.
Increasing  government  support  is  one  of  the  major  factors  driving  the electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India.
Based on component, the electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India is segmented into hardware and software & services. Hardware comprises  sockets,  cables,  and  charging  units.  Software  &  services include  installation  and  maintenance  of  charging  units,  platform  as  a service, and other services. Other services include battery delivery service and towing service, which are in a very nascent stage in India.Working of EV Charging station
The  electric  vehicle  charging  station  is  composed  of  several  electrical vehicle  charging  machines,  each  electric  vehicle  charging  machine  is composed of transformer, capacitor, control unit having a good quality processor with inbuilt memory for software to operate the station.
The charging station has a charging cord and plug which connects to the vehicle via an appropriate plug, it is designed with stand dimensions to fit the charging port of the vehicle.
The  electrical  power  received  from  grid  is  transferred  to  an  electrical vehicle charging machine via an appropriate distribution and control panel which  essentially  has  various  safety  and  fail  safe  devices  required  to handle appropriate electric load.
The electrical power is supplied to electric vehicle charging machine which utilizes its transformer set to vary the input AC voltage to required value, this value is decided based on level of charging selected by the user.
Level  1  Charging  option  provides  110-120V  AC  alternating  current  at charger  point,  Level  2  Charging  option  provides  220  to  240V  AC  at charging point, while Level 3 charging requires 3 phase input AC supply which is then passed through transformer and then rectifier, followed by the ripple factor reducing circuit so as to obtain the DC power supply which is supplied to charging point.Working of EV Charging station
The  various  interface  and  control  actions  are  governed  by  the  control system  as  per  the  software  feed  in  the  machine  based  on  which  its classified into smart or dumb charging machine. The processor present in the control unit processes the data algorithm built in the software as per which  the  input  are  requested  from  the  user,  based  on  these  input charging of vehicle takes place.EV batteries charging system
This charging system is an AC-DC power circuit that must be controlled in order to respect the vehicles' batteries nominal characteristics to preserve their  lifespan.  Additionally,  it  should  monitor  the  batteries  during  their operation to prevent damages  during  the  charging  or discharging processes.  The  ACDC power circuit can  be  implemented  with  different topologies according to the characteristics desired for the system.Land &Building required:

-  Cost of the machine is other than transportation & Packaging cost.Service charges and Revenue charges
In electric vehicle charging station Rs. 30 per hour Service charges are charged for the charging of vehicles.
Other than that clients are charged based upon their vehicle on the% basis of hours. Averagely machine took approx. 4 hours to charge a vehicles with the help of AC Machine and approx. Half With the help of DC Machine.
Note: It's good to open these Charging Station in Mall etc. because there electricity charges are also very nominal (like: 4.5 per unit instead of 8 per unit at a normal place)Revenue Charges Of AC machine
